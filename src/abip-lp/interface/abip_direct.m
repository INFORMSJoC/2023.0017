%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ADMM-Based Interior-Point Method for solving linear programs (abip_direct):  
%
% This implements a LP solver using sparse LDL^T factorization. It solves: 
% 
% min. c'x, 
% s.t. Ax = b, x>=0. 
% 
% where x \in R^n, A \in R^(m*n) and b \in R^m.  
%
% this uses the direct linear equation solver version of ABIP. 
%
% data must consist of data.A, data.b, data.c, where A,b,c used as above.
% 
% Optional fields in the params struct are:
%   max_ipm_iters : 	maximum number of IPM iterations. 
%   max_admm_iters : 	maximum number of ADMM iterations.
%   eps : 		        quitting tolerance.
%   sigma : 		    aggressiveness measurement of the IPM framework. 
%   alpha : 		    over-relaxation parameter, between (0,2), alpha=1 is unrelaxed.
%   normalize : 	    heuristic nomarlization procedure, between 0 and 1, off or on. 
%   scale : 		    heuristic rescale procedure, only used if normalize=1. 
%   adaptive : 		    heuristic barzilai-borwein spectral procedure.
%   verbose : 		    verbosity level (0 or 1)
%
% to warm-start the solver add guesses for (x, y, s) to the data struct
